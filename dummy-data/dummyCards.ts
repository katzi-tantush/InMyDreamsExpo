    'Bajadasaurus is a genus of sauropod dinosaur of northern Patagonia, Argentina, from around 145 to 133 million years ago during the Early Cretaceous epoch. It was first described in 2019 based on a single specimen (elements pictured) found in 2010 that includes a largely complete skull and parts of the neck. The only species is Bajadasaurus pronuspinax. The genus is a member of Dicraeosauridae, a group of relatively small and short-necked sauropods. Bajadasaurus sported bifurcated (two-pronged), extremely elongated neural spines extending from the neck; the 2019 description of Bajadasaurus suggested that they could have served as passive defense against predators. The skull was slender and equipped with around 48 teeth that were pencil-shaped and restricted to the front of the jaws'
